# Community Detection in Social Networks: A Comparative Study

## 📌 Overview

This project explores **community detection in social networks** using graph mining algorithms. The objective is to compare multiple community detection techniques on a real-world dataset: the Facebook combined ego-network dataset from Stanford SNAP.

By combining centrality analysis and community detection methods, the project uncovers the structural organization of the network, identifies influential nodes, and evaluates how different algorithms partition the graph into meaningful communities.

## 🧪 Methods

### 📈 Centrality Measures

| Measure     | Purpose                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| Degree      | Direct connections                |
| Betweenness | Bridge importance                 |
| Closeness   | Average distance to others        |
| Eigenvector | Influence via important neighbors |
| PageRank    | Link-based importance score       |

### 🧩 Community Detection

| Algorithm         | Type             | Description                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Louvain           | Modularity-based | Maximizes modularity           |
| Label Propagation | Diffusion-based  | Neighbor majority labeling     |
| Girvan–Newman     | Divisive         | Removes high-betweenness edges |

---

## 📌 Key Findings

* Central nodes are consistently identified across multiple metrics
* Louvain produces well-balanced communities and scales efficiently
* Label Propagation is fast but less stable across runs
* Girvan–Newman provides hierarchical insight but is computationally expensive
* High betweenness nodes often act as bridges between communities

---

## 🧠 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how graph mining techniques reveal hidden structures in social networks. By combining centrality analysis with community detection, we gain insights into:

* Influential users
* Community organization
* Algorithm performance trade-offs
