# Community Detection in Social Networks: A Comparative Study

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on **community detection** in social networks using various graph mining algorithms. The primary goal is to compare the performance and results of different community detection techniques on a real-world social graph—the **Facebook combined ego-network dataset** from Stanford SNAP.

By analyzing centrality measures and applying community detection algorithms, this project aims to uncover the underlying structure of the network, identify key influencers, and evaluate how different algorithms partition the graph into meaningful communities.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [Stanford SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ego-Facebook.html)
- **Description**: A combined ego-network of 10 Facebook circles
- **Format**: Edge list (undirected)
- **Statistics**:
  - Nodes: 4,039
  - Edges: 88,234

Betweenness	Frequency of a node lying on shortest paths between others
Closeness	Inverse of average distance to all other nodes
Eigenvector	Influence based on neighbors' importance
PageRank	Google's algorithm ranking nodes by link importance
🧩 Community Detection Algorithms
Algorithm	Type	Description
Louvain	Modularity-based	Optimizes community structure by maximizing modularity

📌 Results & Observations

    The top 10 most central nodes are consistently identified across multiple centrality measures.

    Louvain produces well-balanced communities and runs efficiently on large graphs.

    Label Propagation is extremely fast but less stable across runs.

    Girvan-Newman provides a hierarchical view but is computationally expensive.

    Nodes with high betweenness centrality often act as bridges between communities.

🧠 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how graph mining techniques can reveal hidden structures in social networks. By combining centrality analysis with community detection, we gain insights into:

    Who the key players are

    How communities are organized

    Which algorithms are best suited for different types of network analysis
